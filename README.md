# Ok Noted - Android Note-Taking App (View vs. Compose Comparison)
![ComposeVsView](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0dc912b8-0ba3-4560-83b0-639b24206ff9)

**Compose (Left)** and **View (Right)**

---

**Ok Noted** is an Android note-taking app designed to demonstrate the differences between **traditional View-based UI** (XML) and modern **Jetpack Compose** implementations. This project serves as a practical comparison for developers to explore both paradigms side-by-side, with the same core features (create, read, edit, delete notes) built using different UI frameworks.

---

## üìñ Project Purpose  
This repository showcases:  
- **How the same app features** (note management) can be implemented in **View-based UI** vs. **Jetpack Compose**.  
- **Migration steps** from View to Compose (via the `compose` branch).  
- A clean, **Compose-only implementation** for reference.  

Developers can compare codebases to understand:  
‚úÖ Structural differences between XML layouts and Compose components.  
‚úÖ How state management and navigation differ between the two approaches.  
‚úÖ The evolution of UI development in Android from Views to Compose.

## üåø Branches Overview  

### 1. **`main` Branch**  
- **View-based UI** (traditional XML layouts).  
- Implements note management using `Activity`, and View components (e.g., `RecyclerView`).  
- **Manifest entry**: The `MainActivity` launches the View-based implementation.  

### 2. **`compose` Branch**  
- **Hybrid codebase** with both View and Compose components in the source code.  
- **Only the Compose UI is active** at runtime (the View components are retained for reference but not used).  
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates incremental migration to Compose while retaining legacy code for comparison.  
- **Manifest entry**: Launches a `MainComposeActivity` with Compose-based features.  

### 3. **`compose-only` Branch**  
- **Pure Jetpack Compose** implementation.  
- All View-based code (XML, Activities) has been removed.  
- Uses modern Compose patterns like `ViewModel`, `Navigation Compose`, and declarative UI.

## üöÄ Getting Started  
1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dhanfinix/Ok_Noted.git
   ```

2. **Switch branches to compare implementations**:  
   - **View-based**:  
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     ```  
   - **Compose with legacy View code**:  
     ```bash
     git checkout compose
     ```  
   - **Compose-only**:  
     ```bash
     git checkout compose-only
     ```  

3. **Open in Android Studio** and run the app to explore the UI/UX differences.

## üîç Code Comparison Tips  
Open The `compose` branch to compare easily see:  
  - How XML layouts translate to composable functions.  
  - Differences in navigation (`startActivity` vs. `NavHost`).  
  - Data handling (e.g., `RecyclerView.Adapter` vs. `LazyColumn`).
